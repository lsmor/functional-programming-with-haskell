This online book is a translation of ["Programación Funcional con Haskell"](https://jaalonso.github.io/materias/PFconHaskell/temas.html) by [José A. Alonso Jiménez](https://jaalonso.github.io/) at University of Seville. It is suitable for students with or without prior knowledge in functional programming or progamming in general.

The book's goal is to provide a set of examples written using functional programming techniques. This book does not cover some common topics in Haskell learning materials like Functors or Monads as it is focused on developing a "functional programming mindset" rather than learning how to build real world applications in Haskell. The main topics it covers are:

- Basic functions
- Types and Typeclasses
- Functions by comprehension
- Recursive functions
- Higher order functions
- Lazyness
- Data Structures

Aside this book you have a companion set of exercises to improve your Haskell. TODO: add link to exercises
