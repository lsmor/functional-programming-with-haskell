This online book is a translation of ["Programación Funcional con Haskell"]($github-original-repo$) by [José A. Alonso Jiménez]($github-original-user$) at University of Seville. It is suitable for students with or without prior knowledge in functional programming or progamming in general. This book is separated in two parts:

- The one you are reading: containing examples and theory
- A companion set of exercises to be solved by yourself. TODO: add link to exercises

The book's goal is to provide a set of examples written using functional programming techniques. This book does not cover some common topics in other Haskell materials like Functors or Monads as it is focused on developing a "functional programming mindset" rather than learning how to build real world applications in Haskell. The main topics it covers are:

- Basic functions
- Types and Typeclasses
- Functions by comprehension
- Recursive functions
- Higher order functions
- Lazyness
- Data Structures
